## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- See the social media share links when they click the share icon

I have ensured a responsive layout to accommodate various screen sizes and incorporated JavaScript functionality to enable social media sharing upon clicking the share icon.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

You will find all the required assets in the `/design` folder. The assets are already optimized.

(Examples of code snippets that I will add from my code)

### Continued development

The Article Preview Component project has helped me refine my skills in responsive design and JavaScript event handling. In future projects, I aim to explore more advanced techniques for interactive components and user interfaces.
