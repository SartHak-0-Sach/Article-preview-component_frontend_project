## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- See the social media share links when they click the share icon

I have ensured a responsive layout to accommodate various screen sizes and incorporated JavaScript functionality to enable social media sharing upon clicking the share icon.

### How to setup the project

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository using GitHub Desktop or Git Bash:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SartHak-0-Sach/Article-preview-component_frontend_project.git
   ```
2. Open the project folder in your code editor.
3. Run the project using a live server extension or deploy it using Netlify, Vercel, or another web hosting and deployment service.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox
- DOM manipulation

You will find all the required assets in the `/design` folder. The assets are already optimized.

There is also a `style-guide.md` file containing the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.

### What I learned

This project is a very beginner friendly project that can help you understand and implement basic HTML and CSS syntax along with some core JavaScript concepts like DOM manipulation as shown below.

<b>js = proud of this function</b>

```
// Post Share 
let shareBtn = document.querySelector(".shareBtn");
shareBtn.addEventListener("click", () => {
    shareBtn.classList.toggle("active");
    document.querySelector(".shareMenu").classList.toggle("active")
})
```

### Continued development

The continuously learning journey of a programmer never ends. This project made me realize that there are many concepts that I need to work upon including fundamentals like flex-box and its properties, to more complex concepts like working with fetch and async await in javascript. These areas are some that I think I need to work more upon in the upcoming future as they highlight some of the most significant regions of web development that are important for every developer to know of. 

These key points mentioned here will help me grow accountable and consistent towards improving at writing good quality code and be a successful full stack developer one day.

### Useful resources

- [MDN documentation DOM](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model) - This helped me for writing the above code. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [MDN documentation hover state for CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:hover) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand hover states. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
